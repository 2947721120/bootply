Bootstrap Themes, Components (Tiles, Cards, Centering, Option Tables), CSS tricks, JavaScript and jQuery plugins for Bootstrap by Bootply.com
We hope you find them useful, responsive.. and you can fiddle with them at http://bootply.com (A Bootstrap Playground)

Option Tables
==============
Frequently used for pricing, but these zoomable, shrinkable, centerable option tables actuall use DIV elements not tables.


Cards
==============
Because empty Bootstrap spans are boring, use these classes to group spanX's into sleek (and stylish)"cards" in a row.


Tiles
==============
Pair them with the "flat" look to create Metro / Windows8 style boxy spans.


Centering Helpers
==============
Bootstrap 2.x does not center odd numbers of spanX's within a row. These classes are not pixel perfect (as we'll expect from Bootstrap 3.0),
but are useful for centering. Instead of using .offsetX to shift your .spanX, use these 'half' offset spans..

- .offsetHalf
- .offsetHalf1
- .offsetHalf2
- .offsetHalf3
- .offsetHalf4
